# Boom Bot

A Telegram bot that provides boom counts and plays Craps.

## Features

*   `/boom`: Sends a random number (1-5) of ðŸ’¥ emojis.
*   `/boom <number>`: Sends the specified number (1-5) of ðŸ’¥ emojis.
*   `/boom <number > 5>`: Sends a sassy reply.
*   `/boom <number < 1>`: Sends a different sassy reply.
*   `/boom <non-number>`: Sends a sassy reply about needing a number.
*   `/howmanybooms <question>`: Asks the bot how many booms something deserves (e.g., `/howmanybooms does my cat deserve`). The bot remembers questions and provides consistent (randomly assigned) answers using NLTK for fuzzy matching.
*   Sending a photo with `/howmanybooms <question>` in the caption: Same as the text command, but triggered by a photo caption.
*   **Craps Game (Multi-Channel & Multi-Player):**
    *   `/roll`: Rolls the dice for the current channel's Craps game. Resolves bets for all players in the channel.
    *   `/bet <type> <amount>`: Places a bet for the user in the current channel. Valid types include `pass_line`, `dont_pass`, `field`, `place_4`, `place_5`, `place_6`, `place_8`, `place_9`, `place_10`. (e.g., `/bet pass_line 10`, `/bet place 6 12`).
    *   `/showgame`: Displays the current channel's game state (Point, Phase) and the user's current balance and active bets.
    *   `/resetmygame`: Resets the user's balance to the starting amount ($100) and clears their bets within the current channel.
    *   `/crapshelp`: Shows detailed rules and commands for the Craps game.
